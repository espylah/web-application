## Contributing

Apisentra is open source. Contributions are welcome.

### How to contribute

1. **Open an issue** — describe the bug or feature you want to work on. Wait for a maintainer to confirm the issue is in scope before starting work.

2. **Fork & branch** — once the issue is approved, fork the repository and create a branch named after the issue:
   ```
   git checkout -b issue-42-detection-endpoint
   ```

3. **Make your changes** — follow the existing code style. For the backend, add tests covering your changes (`*IT.java` / `*E2EIT.java`).

4. **Open a pull request** — reference the issue in the PR description (`Closes #42`). PRs without a linked issue will not be reviewed.

### Areas most needing help

- Detection event ingestion & storage (items 8–10)
- On-device YOLO inference integration (item 20)
- Frontend detection visualisation (items 29–30)
